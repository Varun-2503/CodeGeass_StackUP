## How it Works ?
1. In the home page of the website, clicking on the "Become an Otaku" will redirect you to the registration page and clicking on the "Login" page will redirect you to the login page. 

2. After registration, you will be automatically redirected to the login page and login using the credentials provided at the registration interface. 

3. Products list will be visible and to filter the customers' interests, we have provided a search filter which enables them to filter out their requirements and products they liked. 

4. A cart button has also been provided, which upon clicked, redirects to the cart page. The backend and frontend of the cart has not been fully integrated yet but the data we enter manually through the database will be displayed in the cart page. 

5. A logout button has also been used to enable current user to logout from the project page. Upon clicked, the logout page will redirect the user to the home page.

We tried to create the frontend using React library of JS but we were unable to merge the frontend and backend so hence we tried the whole project using django and html pages.
